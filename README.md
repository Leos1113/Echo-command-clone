# Rust clone of echo unix command

In my process of learning rust I want to create a rust cli app.

I'm following the book "Command-Line Rust" by Ken Youens-Clark.

The idea is learn the basics from the book and try to recreate more complicated command of linux in rust.

## What I learn

I already know the basics of rust and the toolchain.

Then for now I learn:

- Clap basics
- Rust testing, very basic approach
- How works the reading of args in rust
- How works the result type
- How implement a CI for run the tests on github (on my own, it's not part of the book)
